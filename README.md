## Filling Good~ has one single purpose: To help users quickly copy their stored professional information into job application forms.

Every feature serves this single purpose:
- Profile storage → Saves job application data
- Multiple profiles → Different data for different job types
- Copy buttons → One-click copying into application forms
- Export feature → Backup job application data

The extension does not include any unrelated functionality such as ads, analytics, cryptocurrency, games, or other tools. It exclusively focuses on speeding up the job application process by eliminating repetitive typing.
